## Python Variables - Naming Convention
- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )

:::info
Python Naming Conversions
- **Camel case** − First letter is a lowercase, but first letter of each subsequent word is in uppercase. For example: kmPerHour, pricePerLitre
- **Pascal case** − First letter of each word is in uppercase. For example: KmPerHour, PricePerLitre
- **Snake case** − Use single underscore (_) character to separate words. For example: km_per_hour, price_per_litre

## Creating Python Variables
A variable stores a piece of data and gives it a name
```py 
counter = 100          # Creates an integer variable
miles   = 1000.0       # Creates a floating point variable
name    = "Zara Ali"   # Creates a string variable
is_it_thursday    = True  
is_it_friday    = False  
```
## Deleting Python Variables
```py
del variable_name  # for single
del variable_name1, variable_name2  # for multiple

```

## Getting Type of a Variable
 data type of a Python variable using `type()`
```py
x = "Zara"
y =  10
z =  10.10

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
```

## Casting Python Variables
```python
x = str(10)    # x will be '10'
y = int(10)    # y will be 10 
z = float(10)  # z will be 10.0

print( "x =", x )
print( "y =", y )
print( "z =", z )
```
## Python Variables - Multiple Assignment
```py
a=b=c=10
a,b,c = 10,20,30
a,b,c = 1,2,"Zara Ali"
```

## Python Local Variables
Python Local Variables are defined inside a function. We can not access variable outside the function.
```py
def sum(x,y):
   sum = x + y
   return sum
print(sum(5, 10))
```
Python Global Variables
Any variable created outside a function can be accessed within any function and so they have global scope
```py
x = 5
y = 10
def sum():
   sum = x + y
   return sum
print(sum())
```
## Constants in Python
Python doesn't have any formally defined constants, However you can indicate a variable to be treated as a constant by using all-caps names with underscores. For example, the name PI_VALUE
:::info
The naming convention using all-caps is sometimes referred to as screaming snake case - where the all-caps (screaming) and the underscores (snakes).
