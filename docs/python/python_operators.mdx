## Types of Python Operators
- Arithmetic Operators
- Comparison (Relational) Operators
- Assignment Operators
- Logical Operators
- Bitwise Operators
- Membership Operators
- Identity Operators

## Python Arithmetic Operators
Python Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc
assume that the values of a and b are 10 and 20, respectively

| Operator |	Name |	Example |
|----|----|----|
| + |	Addition	| a + b = 30 |
| -	| Subtraction	| a b = -10 | 
|	*	|	Multiplication	|	a * b = 200 |	
|	/	|	Division	|	 b / a = 2 |	
|	 %	|	Modulus	|	b % a = 0 #It returns the remainder|	
|	**	|	Exponent	|	a\**b =10**20|	
|	//	|	Floor Division	|	9//2 = 4|
```py 
# the floating-point arithmetic somethings it will give extra values `ex:a= 0.1+0.2=0.3` but python gives 0.3000000988 this is not a issue so use round or math.isclose
import math
a = 0.1 + 0.2
print(a)
print(round(a, 2)) 
print(math.isclose(a, 0.3))
```

### Floor Division
If both operands are positive, floor operator returns a number with fractional part removed from it. For example, the floor division of 9.8 by 2 returns 4 (pure division is 4.9, strip the fractional part, result is 4).

But if one of the operands is negative, the result is rounded away from zero (towards negative infinity). Floor division of -9.8 by 2 returns 5 (pure division is -4.9, rounded away from 0).

## Python Comparison Operators
Python Comparison operators compare the values on either side

| Operator | Name                    | Example               |
|----------|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| `==`     | Equal                   | `(a == b)` is false   |
| `!=`     | Not equal               | `(a != b)` is true   |
| `>`      | Greater than            | `(a > b)` is false   |
| `<`      | Less than               | `(a < b)` is true    |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal   | `(a >= b)` is false  |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal      | `(a <= b)` is true   |

## Python Assignment Operators
Python Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.
|Operator	| Example |	Same As |
|-----|-----|-----|
| =	| a = 10	| a = 10 |
| +=	| a += 30	| a = a + 30 |
| -=	| a -= 15	| a = a - 15 |
| *=	| a *= 10	| a = a * 10 |
| /=	| a /= 5	| a = a / 5 |
| %=	| a %= 5	| a = a % 5 |
| **=	| a **= 4	| a = a ** 4 |
| //=	| a //= 5	| a = a // 5 |
| &=	| a &= 5	| a = a & 5 |
| |=	| a |= 5	| a = a | 5 |
| ^=	| a ^= 5	| a = a ^ 5 |
| `>>=`	| `a >>= 5`	| `a = a >> 5` |
| `<<=` |	`a <<= 5`	|  `a = a << 5 ` |

## Python Logical Operators
Python logical operators are used to combile two or more conditions and check the final result.
Assume variable a holds 10 and variable b holds 20
Operator	Name	Example
and	AND	a and b
or	OR	a or b
not	NOT	not(a)
### Logical "and" Operator Truth Table

|a	|b	|a and b|
|---|--|---|
|F	|F	|F|
|F	|T	|F|
|T	|F	|F|
|T	|T	|T|

### Logical "or" Operator Truth Table
|a	|b	|a or b|
|---|--|---|
|F	|F	|F|
|F	|T	|T|
|T	|F	|T|
|T	|T	|T|
## Python Membership Operators
Python's membership operators test for membership in a sequence, such as strings, lists, or tuples.
Operator	Description	Example
in	Returns True if it finds a variable in the specified sequence, false otherwise.	a in b
not in	returns True if it does not finds a variable in the specified sequence and false otherwise.	a not in b
```py
a = 10
b = 20
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]

print ("a:", a, "b:", b, "list:", list)

if ( a in list ):
   print ("a is present in the given list")
```
### Membership Operator with Lists and Tuples
```py
var = [10,20,30,40]
a = 20
b = 10
c = a-b
d = a/2
print (a, "in", var, ":", a in var)
print (b, "not in", var, ":", b not in var)
print (c, "in", var, ":", c in var)
print (d, "not in", var, ":", d not in var)
```
### Membership Operator with Sets
```py
var = {10,20,30,40}
a = 10
b = 20
print (b, "in", var, ":", b in var)
var = {(10,20),30,40}
a = 10
b = 20
print ((a,b), "in", var, ":", (a,b) in var)
```
### Membership Operator with Dictionaries
```py
var = {1:10, 2:20, 3:30}
a = 2
b = 20
print (a, "in", var, ":", a in var)
print (b, "in", var, ":", b in var)
```
## Python Identity Operators
Python identity operators compare the memory locations of two objects.

Operator	Description	Example
is	Returns True if both variables are the same object and false otherwise.	a is b
is not	Returns True if both variables are not the same object and false otherwise.	a is not b

```py
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
c = a

print(a is c) # Output True
print(a is b) # Output False

print(a is not c) # Output False
print(a is not b) # Output True
```
