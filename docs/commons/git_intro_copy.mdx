---


## Getting Started
Start a new repo:
```bash
git init
```
Clone an existing repo:
```bash
git clone <url>
```
## Prepare to Commit
Add untracked file or unstaged changes:
```bash
git add <file>
```

Add all untracked files and unstaged changes:
```bash
git add --all or git add -A
git add .
git add * (new or modified not deleted one)
git add filename.txt
git add *.txt  (only root folder no subfolder)


```
Choose which parts of a file to stage:

```bash
git add -p
```
Delete file:
```bash
git rm <file>
```
Unstage one file:
```bash
git reset <file>
```
Move file:
```bash
git mv <old> <new>
```
Tell Git to forget about a file without deleting it:
```bash
git rm --cached <file>
```
Unstage everything:
```bash
git reset
```

Check what you added:
```bash
git status
```

## Make Commits
Make a commit (and open text editor to write message):
```bash
git commit
```
Make a commit:
```bash
git commit -m 'message'
```

Commit all unstaged changes:
```bash
git commit -am 'message'
```

## Move Between Branches
Switch branches:
```bash
git switch <name>
or
git checkout <name>
```
Create a branch:
```bash
git switch -c <name>
OR
git checkout -b <name>
```
List branches:
```bash
git branch
```
List branches by most recently committed to:
```bash
git branch --sort=-committerdate
```
Delete a branch:
```bash
git branch -d <name>
```
Force delete a branch:
```bash
git branch -D <name>
```
## Diff Staged/Unstaged Changes
Diff all staged and unstaged changes:
```bash
git diff HEAD
```
Diff just staged changes:
```bash
git diff --staged
```
Diff just unstaged changes:
```bash
git diff
```
## Diff Commits
Show diff between a commit and its parent:
```bash
git show <commit>
```
Diff two commits:

```bash
git diff <commit> <commit>
```
Diff one file since a commit:

```bash
git diff <commit> <file>
```
Show a summary of a diff:
```bash
git diff <commit> --stat
git show <commit> --stat
```
:::info
Ways to refer to a commit
- Every time we say \<commit>, you can use any of these:
- a branch        ---|--    main
- a tag               v0.1
- a commit ID         3e887ab
- a remote branch     origin/main
- current commit      HEAD
- 3 commits ago       HEAD^^^ or HEAD~3
:::


## Discard Your Changes
Delete unstaged changes to one file:
```bash {1,3}
git restore <file>
or
git checkout <file>
```

Delete all staged and unstaged changes to one file:
```bash
git restore --staged --worktree <file>
OR
git checkout HEAD <file>
```
Delete all staged and unstaged changes:
```bash

git reset --hard
```
Delete untracked files:
```bash
git clean
```
'Stash' all staged and unstaged changes:
```bash
git stash
```
## Edit History
"Undo" the most recent commit (keep your working directory the same):
```bash
git reset HEAD^
```
Squash the last 5 commits into one:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~6
```  
:::tip
Then change "pick" to "fixup" for any commit you want to combine with the previous one
:::
Undo a failed rebase:

```bash
git reflog BRANCHNAME
Then manually find the right commit ID in the reflog, then run:

git reset --hard <commit>
```
Change a commit message (or add a file you forgot):
```bash
git commit --amend
```
## Code Archaeology
Look at a branch's history:

```bash
git log main
git log --graph main
git log --oneline
```
Show every commit that modified a file:
```bash
git log <file>
```
Show every commit that modified a file, including before it was renamed:

```bash
git log --follow <file>
```

Find every commit that added or removed some text:
```bash
git log -G banana
```
Show who last changed each line of a file:
```bash
git blame <file>
```
## Combine Diverged Branches
Combine with rebase:
```bash
git switch banana
git rebase main
```
Before:

![Rebase  before example](/img/before_rebase.svg)


After:
<div style={{ textAlign: 'left' }}>
  <img src="/img/after_rebase.svg" alt="Rebase after example" width="600" />
</div>

Combine with merge:
```bash
git switch main
git merge banana
```
Before

![merge before example](/img/before_merge.svg)

After

![merge after example](/img/after_merge.svg)

Combine with squash merge:
```bash
git switch main
git merge --squash banana
git commit
```
Before

![squash before example](/img/before_squash.svg)

After

![squash after example](/img/after_squash.svg)

Bring a branch up to date with another branch (aka "fast-forward merge"):
```bash
git switch main
git merge banana
```
Before

![combine before example](/img/before_combine.svg)

After

![combine after example](/img/after_combine.svg)

Copy one commit onto the current branch:
```bash
git cherry-pick <commit>
```
Before

![cherry pick before example](/img/before_cherrypick.svg)

After

![cherry pick after  example](/img/after_cherrypick.svg)

## Restore an Old File
Get the version of a file from another commit:
```bash
git checkout <commit> <file>
OR
git restore <file> --source <commit>
```
## Add a Remote
```bash
git remote add <name> <url>
```

## Push Your Changes
Push the main branch to the remote origin:
```bash
git push origin main
```
Push the current branch to its remote "tracking branch":
```bash
git push
```
Push a branch that you've never pushed before:
```bash
git push -u origin <name>
```
Push a branch that you've never pushed before:
```bash
git push -u origin <name>
```
Force push:
```bash
git push --force-with-lease
```
Push tags:
```bash
git push --tags
```
## Pull Changes
Fetch changes (but don't change any of your local branches):
```bash
git fetch origin main
```
Fetch changes and then rebase your current branch:

```bash
git pull --rebase
```
Fetch changes and then merge them into your current branch:

```bash
git pull origin main
OR
git pull
```
## Configure Git
Set a config option:
```bash
git config user.name 'Your Name'
```
Set option globally:
```bash
git config --global ...
```
Add an alias:
```bash
git config alias.st status
```
See all possible config options:
```bash
man git-config
```
## Important Files
Local git config:
```bash
.git/config
```
Global git config:
```bash
~/.gitconfig
```
List of files to ignore:
```bash
.gitignore
```
