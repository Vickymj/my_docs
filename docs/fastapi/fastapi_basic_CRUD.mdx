```
## Query Parameter
```py
@app.get("/shipment")
def get_shipment(id: int) -> dict[str, Any]:
    # Check for shipment with given id
    if id not in shipments:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND,
            detail="Given id doesn't exist!"
        )

    return shipments[id]
```

## Path & Query 
```py
# Use path and query parameters together
@app.get("/shipment/{field}")
def get_shipment_field(field: str, id: int) -> Any:
    return shipments[id][field]
```


## Get by Id
```py
### Read a shipment by id
@app.get("/shipment")
def get_shipment(id: int) -> dict[str, Any]:
    # Check for shipment with given id

        )

    return shipments[id]
```
## Create Method with Query Parameter
```py
### Create a new shipment with content and weight
@app.post("/shipment")
def submit_shipment(content: str, weight: float) -> dict[str, int]:
    # Validate weight
    if weight > 25:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_406_NOT_ACCEPTABLE,
            detail="Maximum weight limit is 25 kgs",
        )
    # Create and assign shipment a new id
    new_id = max(shipments.keys()) + 1
    # Add to shipments dict
    shipments[new_id] = {
        "content": content,
        "weight": weight,
        "status": "placed",
    }
    # Return id for later use
    return {"id": new_id}
```
## Create Method With Request Body
```py
@app.post("/shipment")
def submit_shipment(query_param: Any, req_body: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, int]:
    # Get query parameters as well
    print(f"\nQuery Param: {query_param}\n")
    # Extract fields from request body
    content = req_body["content"]
    weight = req_body["weight"]
    # Validate weight
    if weight > 25:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_406_NOT_ACCEPTABLE,
            detail="Maximum weight limit is 25 kgs"
        )
    # Create and assign shipment a new id
    new_id = max(shipments.keys()) + 1
    # Add to shipments dict
    shipments[new_id] = {
        "content": content,
        "weight": weight,
        "status": "placed",
    }
    # Return id for later use
    return {"id": new_id}
```
## Update Method
```py
### Update fields of a shipment
@app.patch("/shipment")
def update_shipment(id: int, body: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
    # Update data with given fields
    shipments[id].update(body)
    return shipments[id]
```


## Patch Method

```py
### Patch method using query params
@app.patch("/shipment")
def patch_shipment(
    # required
    id: int,
    # not required
    content: str | None = None,
    weight: float | None = None,
    status: str | None = None,
):
    shipment = shipments[id]

    # Update the provided fields
    if content:
        shipment["content"] = content
    if weight:
        shipment["weight"] = weight
    if status:
        shipment["status"] = status

    # Reflect changes in datastore
    shipments[id] = shipment
    return shipment


### Patch method using request body
### Different url as same method exists
@app.patch("/shipment_field")
def patch_shipment_with_req_body(id: int, body: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
    # Update data with given fields
    shipments[id].update(body)
    return shipments[id]
```

##  Delete Method

```py 
### Delete a shipment by id
@app.delete("/shipment")
def delete_shipment(id: int) -> dict[str, str]:
    # Remove from datastore
    shipments.pop(id)

    return {"detail": f"Shipment with id #{id} is deleted!"}

```
