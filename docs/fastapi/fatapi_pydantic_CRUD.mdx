## CRUD 

```py title="schemas.py"
from enum import Enum
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field


class ShipmentStatus(str, Enum):
    placed = "placed"

class BaseShipment(BaseModel):
    content: str

    destination: int


class ShipmentRead(BaseShipment):
    status: ShipmentStatus


class ShipmentCreate(BaseShipment):
    pass
    

class ShipmentUpdate(BaseModel):
    status: ShipmentStatus
```

```py title='main.py'
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, status
from scalar_fastapi import get_scalar_api_reference

from .schemas import ShipmentCreate, ShipmentRead, ShipmentUpdate


app = FastAPI()

### Shipments datastore as dict
shipments = {
    12701: {"weight": 8.2, "content": "aluminum sheets", "status": "placed", "destination": 11002},
    12702: {"weight": 14.7, "content": "steel rods", "status": "shipped", "destination": 11003},
    12703: {"weight": 11.4, "content": "copper wires", "status": "delivered", "destination": 11002},
    12704: {"weight": 17.8, "content": "iron plates", "status": "in transit", "destination": 11005},
    12705: {"weight": 10.3, "content": "brass fittings", "status": "returned", "destination": 11008},
}


###  a shipment by id
@app.get("/shipment", response_model=ShipmentRead)
def get_shipment(id: int):
    # Check for shipment with given id
    if id not in shipments:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND,
            detail="Given id doesn't exist!",
        )

    return shipments[id]


### Create a new shipment with content and weight
@app.post("/shipment", response_model=None)
def submit_shipment(shipment: ShipmentCreate) -> dict[str, int]:
    # Create and assign shipment a new id
    new_id = max(shipments.keys()) + 1
    # Add to shipments dict
    shipments[new_id] = {
        **shipment.model_dump(),
        "status": "placed",
    }
    # Return id for later use
    return {"id": new_id}


### Update fields of a shipment
@app.patch("/shipment", response_model=ShipmentRead)
def update_shipment(id: int, body: ShipmentUpdate):
    # Update data with given fields
    shipments[id].update(body)
    return shipments[id]


### Delete a shipment by id
@app.delete("/shipment")
def delete_shipment(id: int) -> dict[str, str]:
    # Remove from datastore
    shipments.pop(id)

    return {"detail": f"Shipment with id #{id} is deleted!"}


### Scalar API Documentation
@app.get("/scalar", include_in_schema=False)
def get_scalar_docs():
    return get_scalar_api_reference(
        openapi_url=app.openapi_url,
        title="Scalar API",
